# iStrip BLE Light Integration for Home Assistant

This custom integration replicates core features of the official iStrip+ app, enabling control of iStrip BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) LED lights directly from Home Assistant. It communicates over BLE using AES-encrypted commands to provide smooth RGB color and brightness adjustments, just like the original app.

## ‚ú® Features

- Turn iStrip BLE light on/off
- Set RGB color with smooth brightness control
- Communicates via AES-encrypted BLE packets
- Supports automatic Bluetooth device discovery
- Fully asynchronous and compatible with Home Assistant‚Äôs light platform

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Download the integration:**  
   Clone or download this repository.

2. **Copy files:**  
   Copy the `istrip` directory into your Home Assistant `custom_components` folder.

3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

4. **Add the integration via Home Assistant UI:**

- Go to **Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Add Integration**
- Search for **iStrip BLE Light**
- Home Assistant will scan for nearby BLE devices and list them
- Select your device to complete the setup (device name might be something like "SSL-XXXX")

The integration will handle device discovery and configuration automatically.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Once installed, the iStrip BLE light entity will appear in Home Assistant. You can:

- Turn it on/off
- Change its RGB color
- Adjust brightness (0-255)

Commands are sent asynchronously over BLE and encrypted to match the official iStrip+ app protocol.
